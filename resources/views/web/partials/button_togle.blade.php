                <h5>You and the 52 million other young women in the United States—are at risk <i>simply because</i> you have breasts and/or ovaries.</h5>
            </div>

            <div class="fact">
                <h5>Age is important when it comes to breast and ovarian cancer risk: most breast and ovarian cancers develop when women are in their 50s and 60s, but breast cancer in women with a genetic predisposition often develops much earlier, starting when those women are in their 30s and 40s.</h5>
            </div>

            <div class="fact">
                <h5>Certain genetic mutations can cause an increased risk for both breast and ovarian cancers. An ovary may only be the size of an almond, but it’s powerful - <b>2/3 of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer will die from their disease.</b></h5>
            </div>

            <div class="fact">
                <h5><b>There is a clear link between obesity and breast cancer — extra fatty tissue produces extra estrogen, which in turn increases breast cancer risk.</b></h5>
            </div>

            <div class="fact">
                <h5><b>Maintaining a healthy body weight means keeping your BMI between 18.5 and 24.9.</b></h5>
            </div>

            <div class="fact">
                <h5>Breast and ovarian cancers can run in some families. Sometimes this is because mutated genes have been passed down to you from your mother or father. These genes dramatically increase the risk of developing cancer. Other times, there may be a strong family history, but no known genetic mutation.</h5>
            </div>

            <div class="fact">
                <h5>Research shows a 10% increase in breast cancer risk for every 10g of alcohol—that’s <i>one</i> standard drink—consumed each day on average. Limit alcohol to one drink per day or eliminate it entirely.</h5>
            </div>

            <div class="fact">
                <h5>Getting a genetic test is as simple as taking a blood test. The Affordable Care Act requires insurance coverage of genetic testing for women who qualify.</h5>
            </div>

            <div class="fact">
                <h5>One of the most common mutations — <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> — are present in 1 in 400 individuals, 1 in 40 Ashkenazi Jews, 1 in 10 women diagnosed with breast cancer and 1 in 8 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer.</h5>
            </div>

            <div class="fact">
                <h5>Regular exercise – breaking a sweat for 30+ minutes on most days – may reduce your risk of developing breast cancer. You don’t need to become a gym rat — walking counts!</h5>
            </div>

            <div class="fact">
                <h5><i>Nothing</i> has a greater effect on a woman’s level of risk than her family history. Background information from BOTH sides of your family is important.</h5>
            </div>

            <div class="fact">
                <h5>Younger women tend to have denser breast tissue – breasts with more glandular tissue and less fatty tissue – which can make it harder to see tumors on mammograms. Dense breast tissue is linked to a higher risk of breast cancer.</h5>
            </div>

            <div class="fact">
                <h5>Risk for developing breast cancer is significantly increased if a woman received radiation treatments to the chest for another cancer (like Hodgkin’s disease or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma) at a young age, particularly while her breasts were developing. Some reports find it to be as much as 12 times the normal risk.</h5>
            </div>

            <div class="fact">
                <h5>Starting your period under age 12 is linked to an increased risk for breast cancer because it raises total lifetime exposure to estrogen.</h5>
            </div>

            <div class="fact">
                <h5>When you collect family health history, note who had cancer, how old they were at diagnosis, and what type was detected. Remember that information from your father’s side is just as important as your mother’s.</h5>
            </div>

            <div class="fact">
                <h5>Research shows clear reduction in ovarian cancer risk with use of birth control pills. You might have heard oral contraceptives can increase breast cancer risk, but many studies show that if there is any increased risk at all, it is very small, and not associated with the most common, low-dose estrogen pills. Bottom line: there are few lifestyle behaviors that reduce your ovarian cancer risk — <i>except</i> for taking birth control pills.</h5>
            </div>

            <div class="fact">
                <h5>A breast biopsy sometimes shows abnormal cells that are considered a “precancer” (called atypical hyperplasia, or cellular atypia). Patients who have had precancerous cells on biopsy are more likely to have cancer later in life.</h5>
            </div>

            <div class="fact">
                <h5>Pregnancy reduces breast cancer risk by stabilizing breast tissue and lowering total lifetime exposure to estrogen. It also reduces the risk of ovarian cancer by preventing ovulation and therefore the chance for cell growth to “go rogue.”</h5>
            </div>

            <div class="fact">
                <h5>Breastfeeding for a total of 1-2 years lowers total lifetime exposure to estrogen, reducing a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer. It also reduces the chance of ovulation, and therefore also it decreases the risk of ovarian cancer.</h5>
